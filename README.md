# FCSIT Survey App

## Introduction

This is a simple web application built to **compile all FCSIT survey forms** for **faculty courses**. For **usage of FCSIT UM undergraduate students only**.

## Problem Statements

1. **Individual survey form sharing leads to spams**
   Every semester, there is always going to be a period of time especially during mid-semester where students will be required to create survey forms for their group/individual assignments and dissemminate them to the public en masse through various platforms, mainly WhatsApp, Telegram and even email. Dubbed as the '**survey season**', one is expected to find their social media platforms **flooded with endless survey forms** which can sometimes lead to **spams**. This can be quite a nuisance to some especially when the same survey forms are being forwarded in as many common groups as possible to reach more people.

2. **Lack of incentive to fill survey forms**
    Pertaining to point #1, one of the major implications of the survey forms being shared in an unorganised and cluttered manner is that it **further disincentivises people** — which let's face it, are already generally unresponsive when it comes to filling survey forms — from doing so in the first place. 

3. **No Single Point of Reference**
    Due to the **lack of a single, reliable, user-friendly and easily accessible platform** to host all the survey forms, students understandably have no choice but to share their survey forms in multiple platforms in order to reach as many respondents as possible. Students are also **restricted to the target groups that they can access** (e.g. A first year student could not share their survey forms in sophomore or final year students' groups), further limiting the number of possible respondents
